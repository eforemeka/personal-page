#### THE CLOUD RESUME CHALLENGE

I took part in The Cloud Resume Challenge to build and host a copy of my [resume](https://resume.benny.com.ng) in the cloud using mostly Azure services. I wrote about it on medium and you can check it out [here](https://medium.com/@bennando/the-cloud-resume-challenge-with-azure-my-experience-f83695dcf77e).

On this project, I used and learned about Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Storage Account and GitHub Actions.

#### THIS HUGO WEBSITE

I initially built my personal website on Wordpress but I wasn't very satisfied with the speed with which it was serving up pages. I do not quite remember how I stumbled upon [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), but it was just what I needed to quickly build a website that wasn't just lightweight but also quick to load up pages over the internet.

I published my Hugo site to Azure Static Web Apps, with GitHub as a repository, and I get to easily push updates from a local clone of my repo. Easy peasy :). You can learn how to do the same [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo).
