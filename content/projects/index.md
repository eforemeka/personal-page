#### THE CLOUD RESUME CHALLENGE

I took part in The Cloud Resume Challenge to build and host a copy of my [resume](https://resume.benny.com.ng) in the cloud, on Azure. I wrote about it on my medium and you can check it out [here](https://medium.com/@bennando/the-cloud-resume-challenge-with-azure-my-experience-f83695dcf77e).

Here I used and learned about Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Storage Account and GitHub Actions.

What do I still benefit from having done this project? - I make updates to my resume locally and push without having to login to my GitHub or Azure accounts. CI/CD at it's finest! :)
