#### THE CLOUD RESUME CHALLENGE

I took part in The Cloud Resume Challenge to build and host a copy of my [resume](https://resume.benny.com.ng) in the cloud, on Azure. I wrote about it on medium and you can check it out [here](https://medium.com/@bennando/the-cloud-resume-challenge-with-azure-my-experience-f83695dcf77e).

Here, I used and learned about Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Storage Account and GitHub Actions.

What do I benefit from having done this project? - I make updates to my resume locally and deploy without having to log in to my GitHub or Azure accounts. CI/CD at it's finest! :)


#### THIS HUGO WEBSITE

I initially built this website on wordpress but wasn't very impressed with the speed with which it was serving up pages. I noticed that static html pages on my web host loaded much quicker than wordpress' php pages.

I do not quite remember how I stumbled upon Hugo, a static web generator and world's fastest framework for building websites. These are not my words, it says exactly that on their [website](https://gohugo.io). But, it is true what they say, Hugo is fast, and quite easy to set up. 

I published my Hugo site to Azure Static Web Apps, with GitHub as a repository, and I get to easily push updates from a local clone of my repo. Easy peasy :). You can learn how to do the same [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo).
