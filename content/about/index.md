#### WHO AM I??

Hi! I'm Benny and I am a Technical Support Specialist and Project Manager with over eight years of experience and expertise in technical support, wed development, IT infrastructure management and project delivery.

I am support-oriented with a genuine desire to fix problems and improve processes. I also enjoy the satisfaction that comes with 'demystifying a puzzle'. These traits, coupled with my technical abilities, make me an excellent troubleshooter and problem-solver.

#### WHAT CAN I OFFER?

I can offer well-developed skills in conceptualizing and implementing enterprise solutions and have also been able to show time and again my ability to effectively handle up to L3 support cases for both onsite and remote teams, while focusing on improving business processes and delivering the best end-user experiences. 

<!-- #### WHAT DO I *CURRENTLY* SEEK?

I desire to pivot a little from supporting end-users and on-prem infrastructure to building on my experience implementing, optimizing and supporting cloud-based infrastructure, products and solutions. If members of your team can work from anywhere in the world, I would like to be part of your team. I am open to Technical Support Engineer | Infrastructure Engineer | Cloud/DevOps Engineer roles in the EMEA zone. I am also open to discussing offers that come with relocation packages. -->
