WHO AM I??

Hi! I'm Benny and I am a Technical Support Specialist and Cloud Engineer with over six years of experience and expertise in providing enterprise-level technical support and infrastructure workload administration. I am a Certified Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate and also a Google IT Support Professional.

WHAT CAN I OFFER?

I can offer well developed skills at conceptualizing and implementing technological solutions across multiple OS platforms. I have been able to show time and again my ability to effectively handle up to L3 support cases for both onsite and remote teams while focusing on improving business processes and delivering the best end-user experience. 

WHAT DO I SEEK?

Currently, I desire to explore and pivot a little from supporting just end-users and on-prem infrastructure to implementing, optimizing and supporting Saas products and solutions. I am open to taking on Remote Technical Support roles in the EMEA zone.
