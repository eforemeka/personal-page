#### WHO AM I??

Hello there! My name is Benny, and I bring over eight years of experience as a Technical Support Specialist and Project Manager. Throughout my career, I have developed strong skill sets in technical support, web development, IT infrastructure administration, and project management.

One of my standout qualities is my customer-centric approach. I have a genuine desire to solve problems and enhance processes, always striving to provide the best support possible. I find great satisfaction in unraveling complex puzzles and demystifying technical challenges. This combination of traits, coupled with my technical expertise, positions me as an exceptional troubleshooter and problem-solver.

#### WHAT CAN I OFFER?

I possess well-honed abilities in conceptualizing and implementing enterprise solutions, consistently demonstrating my expertise in handling L3 support cases for both onsite and remote teams. Throughout my experience, I have remained dedicated to enhancing business processes and delivering top-notch end-user experiences. 

<!-- #### WHAT DO I *CURRENTLY* SEEK?

I desire to pivot a little from supporting end-users and on-prem infrastructure to building on my experience implementing, optimizing and supporting cloud-based infrastructure, products and solutions. If members of your team can work from anywhere in the world, I would like to be part of your team. I am open to Technical Support Engineer | Infrastructure Engineer | Cloud/DevOps Engineer roles in the EMEA zone. I am also open to discussing offers that come with relocation packages. -->
