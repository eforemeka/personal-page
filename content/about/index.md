#### WHO AM I??

Hi! I'm Benny and I am a Technical Support Specialist and budding Cloud Engineer with over six years of experience and expertise in providing enterprise-level technical support and infrastructure workload administration. I am a Certified [Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/44eec575-c7ff-4539-ad20-d92e0b6bc2e1/public_url) and a [Google IT Support Professional](https://www.credly.com/badges/e68bf306-2c7d-4877-b211-25204332e6d6/public_url).

I am very support-oriented with a real desire to help people fix their problems and can be obsessively relentless when dealing with difficult technical challenges. I also enjoy the satisfaction that comes with 'demystifying a puzzle'. These traits make me a very good troubleshooter and problem-solver.

#### WHAT CAN I OFFER?

I can offer well-developed skills in conceptualizing and implementing technological solutions across multiple OS platforms. I have been able to show time and again my ability to effectively handle up to L3 support cases for both onsite and remote teams while focusing on improving business processes and delivering the best end-user experience. 

#### WHAT DO I *CURRENTLY* SEEK?

Currently, I desire to explore and pivot a little from supporting just end-users and on-prem infrastructure to implementing, optimizing and supporting SaaS products and solutions. I am open to taking on Remote Technical Support roles in the EMEA zone.
