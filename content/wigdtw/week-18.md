My update for the week ending on 7th May, 2022.

### Personal Website
I did not make a lot of changes to my page last week because I was quite occupied with other things. This week, I will be including my favicon and translating my About page.

### Ghosts of Co-Workers Past
Mr. D called. They need to resolve something that the current IT head is struggling with. It must have gotten so critical he had to reach out. I already sent a YouTube link for the IT head to follow but that didn't help.

### New German words/phrases I learned on Duolingo
* *Schildkroete* - Turtle
* *Geschwister* - Siblings
* *Kartoffelsalat* - Potato Salad
* *Gemeuse* - Vegetables
* *Geschwister* - Siblings
* *Freizeit* - Free time
