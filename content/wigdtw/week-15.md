My update for the week ending on 16th April, 2022.

## Ghosts of Co-Workers Past
Let me just state here that getting contacted by people I have worked with in the past happens a lot more than I would like to admit lol. But I like it. I like that when people think about who to run to with their IT problems, however little, they think about me.

I'll start referring to them by their initials so that I stop using 'someone' lol.

Mr. D's friend reached out because his friend needed to reinstall windows on their computer. I wasn't closeby and would not have been able to help out so I referred him to someone else.

## New German words/phrases I learned on Duolingo
* *Weiß* - Know
* *Nacht* - Night
* *Nächte* - Nights
* *Hell* - Bright ( I find this one particularly funny because 'bright as hell' loool
* *Einzelzimmer* - Single room
* *Doppelzimmer* - You guessed it, Double room)
* *Ich freue mich* - I look forward to it.
<!-- * ![The German Sentence Structure stresses me out lol](/static/images/einzelzimmer.jpg) -->

## Books
I am currently reading UNIX AND LINUX SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION HANDBOOK, Fifth Edition by Trent R. Hein, Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Ben Whaley, Dan Mackin.

## TV Series
These are the TV shows I currently follow:
* The Good Doctor S05 E13
* Moon Knight S01 E03 - Steven as Mr. Knight is both hilarious and annoying.

## Miscellaneous
W brought me her laptop to upgrade to Windows 11! I was so happy to see her and even happier to get her laptop upgraded. I love the Windows 11 interface.
