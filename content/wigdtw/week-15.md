My update for the week ending on 16th April, 2022.

## Ghosts of Co-Workers Past
Let me just state here that getting contacted by people I have worked with in the past happens a lot more than I would like to admit lol. But I like it. I like that when people think about who to run to with their IT problems, however little, they think about me.

I'll start referring to them by their initials so that I stop using 'someone' lol.

Mr. D's friend reached out because his friend needed to reinstall windows on their computer. I wasn't closeby and would not have been able to help out so I referred him to someone else.
