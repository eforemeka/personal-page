My update for the week ending on 30th April, 2022.

### Ghosts of Co-Workers Past
Madam J. called. There was this thing i used to help her with when she needed to upload documents to the client's portal. The current team over there was finding it difficult to get it right so she sought my help out of frustration. I assessed what had been done and gave recommendations for a work around. 
Problem Solved.

### New German words/phrases I learned on Duolingo
* *Lieblingessen* - Favorite food
* *Dezember* - December (obviously lol)
* *Kartoffelsalat* - Potato Salad
* *Schildkroete* - Turtle
* *Geschwister* - Siblings
* *Freizeit* - Free time

German is a phonetic language and I love it.
