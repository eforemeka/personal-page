My update for the week ending on 23rd April, 2022.

### Personal Website
I decided to change the Hugo theme I was [previously](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-coder/) using to something [better](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/loveit/). If you are reading this, then welcome to my new theme.

### Ghosts of Co-Workers Past
Mr. K reached out again for what would be the third time in 4 weeks. He wanted some help with his gmail account. The details are too confidential to share so I'd just leave it at that.

T called. Their SAP production server is down. Something about a faulty hard disk. They do not have a backup, which is a bit ridiculous to say the least. I advised they take out the faulty hard disk and slave to another machine. Run a checkdisk to identify fand hopefully rectify fault. I expect some feedback this coming week.

### New German words/phrases I learned on Duolingo
* *Beamter/Beamtin* - Civil Servant
* *Zufrieden* - Content
* *Geschichte* - History
* *HÃ¤sslich* - Ugly
* *Auch* - Also

### TV Series
These are the TV shows I currently follow:
* The Good Doctor S05 E15
* Moon Knight S01 E04 - The episode ended weirdly but I'm curious to see what happens next week.
