My update for the week ending on 23rd April, 2022.

### Pesonal Website
I decided to change the Hugo theme I was using to something better.

### Ghosts of Co-Workers Past
Mr. K reached out again for what would be the third time in 4 weeks. He wanted some help with something about his gmail account. The details are too confidential to share so I'd just leave it at that.

### New German words/phrases I learned on Duolingo
* *Beamter/Beamtin* - Civil Servant
* *Zufrieden* - Content
* *Geschichte* - History
* *Hässlich* - Ugly
* *Einzelzimmer* - Single room
* *Doppelzimmer* - You guessed it, Double room
* *Ich freue mich* - I look forward to it.
* *Schlüssel* - Key.
* *Gute Besserung* - Feel better.
* *Nehmen* - To take.

### Random knowledge I acquired during the week
I have decided to add a new section for totally random and interesting things I learned about or came across during the week
* *Circadian Rhythm* -
* *Do doctors scream STAT! the way they do in The Good Doctor?* -

### TV Series
These are the TV shows I currently follow:
* The Good Doctor S05 E15
* Moon Knight S01 E04 - The episode ended weirdly but I'm curious to see what happens next week.
