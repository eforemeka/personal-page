# personal-page

I used to have my personal website on Wordpress. I did not like that it wasn't very quick to load up my homepage so I sought out an alternative and came across Hugo. 

Hugo is fast, quick to set up and easy use.

My website is published to Azure Static Web Apps and you can do someting similar following this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo).
