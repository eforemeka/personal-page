# personal-page

Previously, I had my personal website on Wordpress. However, I was dissatisfied with its slow loading time, particularly on my homepage. To address this issue, I began searching for alternatives, and in doing so, I discovered Hugo.

Hugo is fast, quick to set up and easy use. You can learn more about how you too can use it [here] (https://gohugo.io/)

My website is published to Azure Static Web Apps. Chckout this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo) if you would like to build something similar.
