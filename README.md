# personal-page

I used to have my personal website on Wordpress. It always took a while to load up and I did not like that, I love it when a webpage loads up with the quickness.
I sought out an alternative and came across Hugo. It is fast, quick to set up and easy use.

My hugo site is published to Azure Static Web Apps and you can do someting similar following this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo).
